# Workflow View

Clicking on the Workflow button will open the Workflow view.

The Workflow view is a central place where you can view all unpublished edits and move the changed items through the editorial workflow. Using the workflow is optional, it's possible to publish items without proceeding through the workflow, either from the workflow screen or the screen where the edits are made.

There are 3 states and item can have in the workflow: Draft, In Review, and Ready. You can move items between these states as you see fit. The workflow is designed to be flexible and allow you to create a workflow that fits your needs.

## Workflow States

### Draft
A draft represents a new piece of content or edits to an existing piece of content that is actively being worked on. Drafts are not visible to the public. Drafts can be moved forward to In Review or directly to Ready.

### In Review
An item in the In Review state is not visible to the public. This is useful for alerting others that the changes are complete and ready to review before they are published. Items in the In Review state can be moved back to Draft or forward to Ready. You can skip the review step and move directly to Ready if no review is necessary.

### Ready
Items in the Ready state are ready to be published. They are still not visible to the public. The Ready state is useful if you need to publish several pieces of content at the same time, or if you want to delay publishing for any other reason. Items in the Ready state can be moved back to Draft or In Review as necessary.

## Workflow Actions

The top of the Workflow screen provides a summary of entries waiting for review and entries waiting to go live. There is also a shortcut to create new entries.

The rest of the screen is divided into 3 columns, one for each status. Each column contains a list of entries in that status. The list shows the entry title and the date the entry was last updated. You can drag and drop entries between columns to change their status. You can also click on an entry to view the entry details.

If you hover over an entry, you will see 2 options, **Delete Changes** and **Publish Changes**. **Delete Changes** will delete the draft and revert the entry to the last published version. **Publish Changes** will publish the entry and make it visible to the public. Note that you can only publish entries in the Ready state from this screen.
