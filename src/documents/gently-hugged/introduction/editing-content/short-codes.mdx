# Short Codes

Short Codes are special codes you can use to display larger, preformatted blocks of text. For example, if you want to show a list of all distribution sites on a page, all you need to do is enter `<DistributionSites />`. Often, these short codes are used to display lists that are entered elsewhere in the site (Distriubtion Sites, Board of Directors, News, etc...). Sometimes they represent more complex things like a PayPal button or a contact form.

One of the benefits of using Short Codes is that when you change some data, you don't need to updated any web pages. For example, in the `<DistributionSites />` above, if you add or remove distribution sites, you don't need to make any changes to the Distributino Sites **Page**. Short code dynamcially pick up any changes you make. Another example is the Handmade Guidelines Link Short Code `<Handmade Guidelines />`. If you update the document, you don't need to make any changes to any pages that use the short code, the new document will be automatically recognized.

Short Codes can be a little confusing at first, but there are only a few rules to know and they become quite easy use. You may not have occasion to use them often, but you may come across them while editing content and it's good to know what they do.

## Syntax

Most often, Short Codes are just a open bracket (`<`), followed by the Short Code name, and then a space, forward-slash, followed by a closing bracket (` />`). A complete example looks like this:
```
<ShortCodeName />
```

Some short codes have options, colors for instance. Options are entered inside the brackets, after the Short Code and before the forward-slash, in the format `optionname="optionvalue"`. Note that there is no space on either side of the equals sign, but the space between the Short Code name and the option is required. The quotes around the optionvalue are also required. For example, an option for color might look like this:
```
<ShortCodeName color="blue" />
```

Lastly, a few short codes can have some text associated with it. For example, a button or link may need some text show on the web site. Text values are entered slightly differently from options, they look like this:
```
<ShortCodeName>
    This is the text to show on the button or link
</ShortCodeName>
```

In this case, the text is sandwiched between 2 Short Code "tags". Note that the forward-slash that was at the end of the Short Code is now moved to the beginning of the shortcode that comes after the text, and there is no space preceding it.

Short Codes are very particular in their formatting. Spaces and symbols are important!
