# Spacer

```
<Spacer size="4" />
```
Add vertical space to a page. You can make the space larger or smaller using the size option. The value passed to size can be any number. A value of 1 would equal roughly the height of one line of text, a value of 2 would equal the height of roughly 2 lines of text, and so on.
