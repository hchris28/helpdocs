# User Interface

When you first log in you will see the admin interface for the web site.

## The Header

Across the top is the header. On the left side of the header there are 3 links to switch functions.

### Content
This is default view. This is where you will find all the options to make changes to content on the web site.

On the left side you will see a menu labeled **Collections** containing links to different views where you can edit various peices of web site content. Each of these will be covered in detail in this document.

### Workflow
This view allows you see changes that are pending (not published), as well as publish changes to the live web site.

### Media
You can manage media from this view. Most often, you will add new media (images and pdf files) when you are working in content. For example, if you are adding content to a web page and want to add an image to the page, you can do that from the Page Editor. The Media view allows for more general operations like searching for media, downloading copies, or deleting media.

<Aside>
Be careful when deleting media from this view. It's very easy to delete images that are being used without knowing it!

On the right side of the header there is a **Quick add** button which allows you to quickly add items (pages, news, etc) and a button you can use to log out.
