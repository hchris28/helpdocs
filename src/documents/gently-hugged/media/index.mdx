Clicking on the Media button will open the Media view. 

The Media view allows you to view and manage all of your image files. You can upload new images, download copies of images, and delete images that are no longer in use.  

<Aside>
    Most of the time you won't need to access this view directly from the header. More often than not you will see this view in the context of [uploading or updating images from within a page or other entry](/gently-hugged/editing-content/images/). It can useful, however, if you need to delete a file or download a copy of an image for use elsewhere, outside the context of editing content.
</Aside>

The media view is the same window that opens up when you choose to add or update an image somewhere in your content. The difference is that your not seeing this view in the context of a specific page or entry.

## Searching for images

On the left side of the window there is a search bar, just begin typing and the list of images will be filtered to match your search.

## Uploading, Downloading, and Deleting Images

On the right side there are several action buttons:

* **Download** - Click this button to download a copy of the selected image to your computer. _This button is only enabled when an image is selected._
* **Upload** - Click this button to upload a new image. You will be asked to select an image from your computer. Once you have selected an image, it will be uploaded to your site and added to the list of images.
* **Delete** - Click this button to delete the selected image. You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the image. _This button is only enabled when an image is selected._

<Aside type="warning">
    Be careful when deleting images. If you delete an image that is being used in your content, it will no longer be available to your visitors.
</Aside>

You also notice a **Copy** button. This button will copy the path of the selected image to your clipboard. However, because of the way we have to handle images, this path is not the path you would use to link to the image. Instead, you can use the insert image feature found in the toolbar in the content editor to add an image to your content. **It is unlikley that this button will be of any use to you, but we are unable to remove it :(**
