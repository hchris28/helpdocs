# Media View

Clicking on the Media button will open the Media View. 

The Media View allows you to view and manage all of your media files. You can upload new files, download copies of files, and delete files that are no longer in use. Most of the time, you will be using the Media View to insert images into your content and won't need to access this view directly. It can useful, however, if you need to delete a file or download a copy of an image for use elsewhere.

<Aside type="warning">
    Be careful when deleting files. If you delete a file that is being used in your content, it will no longer be available to your visitors.
