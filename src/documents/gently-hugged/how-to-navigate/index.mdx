# How to Navigate

When you first log in you will see the admin interface for the web site.

## The Header

![The CMS header](/images/main-header.jpg)

Across the top is the header. On the left side of the header there are 3 links to switch views.

### Contents
This is default view. This is where you will find all the options to make changes to content on the web site. Most of the time you will be working in this view.

You can find out more about the Contents view [here](/gently-hugged/contents/index/).

### Workflow
This view allows you see changes that are pending (not published), as well as publish changes to the live web site.

You can find out more about the Workflow view [here](/gently-hugged/workflow/index/).

### Media
You can manage media from this view. Most often, you will add new media (images and pdf files) when you are working in content. For example, if you are adding content to a web page and want to add an image to the page, you can do that from the Page Editor. The Media view allows for more general operations like searching for media, downloading copies, or deleting media.
