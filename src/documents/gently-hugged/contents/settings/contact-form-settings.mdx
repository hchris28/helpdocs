The Ccontact form settings screen allows you change the behavior of the contact form.

* **CONTACT FORM SUBJECTS**\
    The contact form has a subject field which which visitors can select from. Each subject can have an associated recipient, this allows us to route contact form submission notifications to different people depending on the selected subject. Each subject has a SUBJECT and a NOTIFICATION RECIPIENT. The SUBJECT is the value displayed on the contact form and the NOTIFICATION RECIPIENT is the email address that will receive notifications when this subject is selected.

<Aside>
    The contact form can be aded to a page using the [`<ContactForm /> short code`](/gently-hugged/editing-content/short-codes/contact-form/).
