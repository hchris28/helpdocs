# Fixed Pages

Fixed Pages are very similar to regular Pages, the difference is you can't delete these pages or add new ones. These are special pages that need to be "fixed", meaning that they need to be consistent in their web address and name. However, you can edit the content on these pages.

There is no description, parent, or order field on these pages. They don't appear in any navigation menus.

    While you can change the name here, it's reccommended that you don't.

## Home Page
Here you can edit the content on the Home Page. The Home Page has unqiue formatting to allow for Hero Images and News, but editing the content works like any other page.

## Donate Page
**[UNDER DEVELOPMENT]** This page is the donation form. You can place the `<DonateForm />` short code to display the form, and add any text or images around it. 

## Thank You Page
This is the page that is displayed after someone completes a donation.
