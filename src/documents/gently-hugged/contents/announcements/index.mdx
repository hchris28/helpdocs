# Announcements

Announcements are displayed on the home page, and are given priority over the content to call attention to them. They are useful for providing timely information to visitors. For example a change in office hours or an upcoming event. 

<Aside>
    Unlike news items, announcements are meant to be temporary and not long-lived.
</Aside>

Announcements are fairly simple, there are only 3 fields:

* **TITLE**\
    The title of the Announcment.

* **FEATURED IMAGE**\
    The Featured Image is displayed next to the Body.

* **BODY**\
    The Body is the main text of the Announcement. You can use text formatting here but images are not reccomended. The body should be kept relatively short, though there's no hard and fast rule.
