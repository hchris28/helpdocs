## Hero Image and Text

The hero image is the large image that is found on the home page. You can also add some text and up to 2 buttons that link to other pages. There are quite a few options you can set here, we'll go through each one below.

<Aside>
    All fields on this page are optional!
</Aside>

* **HERO IMAGE**\
    This is the actual image that is shown. Care should be taken to choose an image that looks good with any other elements that are being used (title, text, or calls to action). The ideal dimensions for this image is 16 x 9; 1920 x 1080 pixels is a good choice. 

* **TITLE**\
    The text entered here appears at the top of the hero image, in large text.

* **TEXT**\
    This text is shown below the title, in slightly smaller text.

    <Aside>
        It's best to keep the Title and Text relatively short.

* **ALIGNMENT**\
    Alignment is either left, center, or right. This refers to the horizontal alignment. The content over the hero image is always vertically centered.

* **STYLE**\
    The style is either None, Gradient, or Card. Your choice here depends on taste and can affect the readability of the overlaid text.

    * **None** - The text is overlaid on the image without any styling.
    * **Gradient** - A subtle white gradient is placed behind the text to increase readability.
    * **Card** - A white card is placed behind the text and is readable over any image.

* **CALL TO ACTION (1 & 2)**\
    Calls to action are buttons that appear under the text that link to other pages. There are 2 values to enter here. Each of the values is labeled Optional, but you must enter a value for each if you choose to use a call to action. 

    * **Text** - This is the text that appears in the button.
    * **Link** - This is the page to link to. If it's a page on the Gently Hugged site you can just enter the page, e.g. _/how-to-give_. If you want to link to a page on another site enter the entire address starting with http.
