# Downloads

The downloads section allows you to update various files available on the web site for visitors to download. 

PDF format is recommended, and file sizes should be kept as small as possible.

## Uploading files

The process for uploading and/or selecting files for use is the same wherever you find a File field.

If no file is selected, you will see 2 options:

* **Choose a File**\
    Selecting this will open the Media Assets window where you can select an existing file or upload a new one.  
* **Insert from URL**\
    This option allows you to reference a file that is found elsewhere on the internet by using a URL.
    <Aside type="warning">
        **Insert from URL** is called "Hotlinking" and is generally not recommended. If you use this option make sure you either own the domain you are hotlinking from or have express permission to hotlink the file. The rest of this page focuses on the first option.
    </Aside>

If  file is already selected, you will have 3 options:
* **Choose different file**\
    Open the media assets window to choose or upload a new file to replace the existing file.
* **Replace with URL**\
    Replace the file with a new file found elsewhere on the internet. See the warning about hotlinking above. 
* **Remove file**\
    Remove the file. Note that this does not delete the file, it only removes it from use in this particular field.

## Media Assets Window

If the file you want to use has already been uploaded, you just need to find the file, click on it to select it, and then click on the "Choose Selected" button.

<Aside>
    You can search for files by file name from this window, the list of files is filtered as you start typing in the Search input in the upper left corner. 
</Aside>

If you need to upload a new file, click the Upload button in the upper right corner. You will be presented with the option to select a file from your computer to upload. After you select a file, you will see the new file in the Files list and it will be selected. Now you just click on the "Choose Selected" button.

<Aside>
    This section only covers uploading and selecting files for use in content. To learn more about the other options in the Media Assets window and general media management see the [Media View](/gently-hugged/media/index/) section.
