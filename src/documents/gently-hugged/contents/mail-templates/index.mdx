Mail templates are used when sending automated emails from the web site. This allows you to customize the emails that visitors receive in response to certain actions. For instance, the donation thank you template is used to generate the email sent to the donor.

<Aside>
    Some templates can accept variables to customize the email for specific users. For example, when someone makes a donation they are asked to enter their name. We can use that in the email template like this `Thank you {{name}}!`. In this example, `{{name}}` will be replaced with the donor's name like this `Thank you Jane Doe!`. Available variables will vary by template, see each template for details.
