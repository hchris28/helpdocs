# Pages

The Pages section allows you to edit existing pages, as well as add new pages or remove pages that are no longer needed. 

You are presented with a list of existing pages which you can click to edit the content on that page. 

## Editing Existing Pages

When editing page content, the top of the admin interface will change. From the left, you have:
* **Edit status**\
    This will notify you if you have made any changes after opening the page for edits. 
* **Save** button\
    Click this to save your changes. **This will not publish your changes!**
* **Publication status**\
    This tells you the publication status: Published, Draft, etc.. . This is also a menu that offers other options to change publication status or to duplicate this page if you want to create a new page.
* **Delete published entry**\
    This will delete the page.

<Aside>
For more information about publishing pages and publication statuses take a look at the [Workflow section](/gently-hugged/workflow/index/).

Here are the fields you can change in the Edit Page screen.

* **TITLE**\
    The title is used in various places: the title bar in the browser, the navigation menu, and as a header on the page itself. It may be used in other places, keep in mind that it is a public field that people will see.
* **DESCRIPTION**\
    The description is primarily used for meta data, which is just information that browsers and other internt bots may use to learn about your site/page.
* **BODY**\
    The body is the main content on the page. You can enter rich text here (formatting, links, images).
    <Aside>
        For more information on how to use the rich-text editor see the [Editing Content](/gently-hugged/editing-content/index/) section.
    </Aside>
* **SIDEBAR IMAGE**\
    This image is used as an "accessory" image on the page. It may be modified, so it's best not to use images with any text, try to keep the subject in the center of the image.
* **PARENT**
    Making a selection here will make the current page a "child" of the page you select. This is how you group pages together. Child pages show as a sub-navigation menu on the parent page. Pages without a parent make up the primary navigation menu. 
    <Aside type="warning">
        Don't make a page a "child" of itself, and don't nest child pages more than one level.
    </Aside>
* **ORDER**\
    The order value is a number that controls the order that the pages appear in the navigation or sub-navigation menus. It's a relative value and it's not necessary to make them consecutive.
    <Aside>
        One trick you can use is to number the pages 10, 20, 30... instead of 1,2,3..., that way, if you need to insert a page somewhere you can choose a number in between.
    </Aside>

    Fields marked as optional can be left blank.

## Creating New Pages

You can create a new page by clicking **New Page** button above the list of existing pages. Creating a new page is just like editing existing pages.

## Deleting Pages

You can delete an existing page by opening up a pages to edit, then clicking the **Delete published entry** button.

<Aside>
    If you want to temporarily remove a page from the public web site without actually deleting it, perhaps to save for future use, you can **Unpublish** it from the drop down that appears when you click on the publication status at the top of the page.
