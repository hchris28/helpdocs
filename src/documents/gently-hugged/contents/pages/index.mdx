# Pages

The Pages section allows you to edit existing pages, as well as add new pages or remove pages that are no longer needed. You can also preview changes that haven't been published yet and change the publication status of a page.

You are presented with a list of existing pages which you can click to edit the content on that page.

## Editing Existing Pages

When editing a page, the header at the top of screen will change. 

![The edit page screen](/images/edit-page.jpg)

From the left, you have:

* **Edit status**\
    This will notify you if you have unsaved edits. It will say UNSAVED CHANGES in red text instead of the green CHANGES SAVED.
* **Save** button\
    Click this to save your changes. **This will not publish your changes!**
* **Publication status**\
    This tells you the publication status: Published, Draft, etc.. . This is also a menu that offers other options to change publication status or to duplicate this page if you want to create a new page.
* **Delete published entry**\
    This will delete the page.

When you have saved edits that haven't been published yet, a few things will change.

* **Publication Status**\
    This will change to reflect the current status, either Draft, In Review, or Ready.
* **Publish** button\
    The new Publish button will allow you publish the page immediately by selecting Publish Now, bypassing any review process. You also have options to start creating a new blank page or a new page just like the current one after publishing. There are just convenience features and won't likely be used very often.
* **Check for Preview** or **View Preview**\
    A preview link will appear on the far right side. When you save edits, a preview site is built allowing you to see the effect of your changes before publishing. This build process takes a few minutes. If you see _View Preview_, click it to view the preview site. If you see _Check Preview_, click it to check if the preview site is ready. If it is ready, it will change to _View Preview_.
* **Delete unpublished chages**
    Clicking this will undo _**all**_ of the changes that have been made since the last _**publish**_ (not just the last Save!). 

<Aside>
For more information about publishing pages and publication statuses take a look at the [Workflow section](/gently-hugged/workflow/index/).

Here are the fields you can change in the Edit Page screen.

* **TITLE**\
    The title is used in various places: the title bar in the browser, the navigation menu, and as a header on the page itself. It may be used in other places, keep in mind that it is a public field that people will see.
* **DESCRIPTION**\
    The description is primarily used for meta data, which is just information that browsers and other internt bots may use to learn about your site/page.
* **BODY**\
    The body is the main content on the page. You can enter rich text here (formatting, links, images).
    <Aside>
        For more information on how to use the rich-text editor see the [Editing Content](/gently-hugged/editing-content/index/) section.
    </Aside>
* **SIDEBAR IMAGE**\
    This image is used as an "accessory" image on the page. It may be modified, so it's best not to use images with any text, try to keep the subject in the center of the image.
* **PARENT**\
    Making a selection here will make the current page a "child" of the page you select. This is how you group pages together. Child pages show as a sub-navigation menu on the parent page. Pages without a parent make up the primary navigation menu. 
    <Aside type="warning">
        Don't make a page a "child" of itself, and don't nest child pages more than one level.
    </Aside>
* **ORDER**\
    The order value is a number that controls the order that the pages appear in the navigation or sub-navigation menus. It's a relative value and it's not necessary to make them consecutive.
    <Aside>
        One trick you can use is to number the pages 10, 20, 30... instead of 1,2,3..., that way, if you need to insert a page somewhere you can choose a number in between.
    </Aside>

    Fields marked as optional can be left blank.

## Creating New Pages

You can create a new page by clicking **New Page** button above the list of existing pages. Creating a new page is just like editing existing pages.

## Deleting Pages

You can delete an existing page by opening up a pages to edit, then clicking the **Delete published entry** button.

<Aside>
    If you want to temporarily remove a page from the public web site without actually deleting it, perhaps to save for future use, you can **Unpublish** it from the drop down that appears when you click on the publication status at the top of the page.
