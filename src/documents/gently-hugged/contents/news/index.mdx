# News

News items are displayed on the home page, along side the content. News items can be anything you'd like. They might be links to recent newsletters, notifications of recent happenings, or any other updates you'd like visitors to see. Think of this as a running feed of notable events.

* **TITLE**\
    The Title is the headline of the News item. 

* **PUBLISH DATE**\
    The Publish Date is lamost always whatever date you add the News item to the web site. You can enter any date you like. News items are sorted by Date, in descending order, when they are shown on the web site.

* **FEATURED IMAGE** (Optional)\
    The Featured Image is any image you'd like displayed with the News item. These images can vbe fairly small.

* **BODY** (Optional)\
    The Body is the main text of the News item. You can use text formatting here but images are not reccomended. The body should be kept relatively short, though there's no hard and fast rule. If more detail is required it's appropriate to use the LINK field to link to more information.

* **LINK** (Optional)\
    If you'd like to generate a link to another web page, a file, or a different site altogether you can enter the web address here.
