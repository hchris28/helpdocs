Lists are like mini-databases. This section allows you to easily manage lists on your web site, like collection bin locations or distribution sites.

You can add new items to lists, remove items, update items, or re-order items in the list. After editing a list, the edits must be published in the same way that pages are. 

<Aside>
    A list will almost always have a corresponding short code. The combination of short code and Lists is very powerful and has many benefits. As an example, you can place the `<CollectionBins />` short code on a page to show a formatted list of collection bin locations. If you update the collection bin list, the short code will update automatically and you won't need to edit any page content.
