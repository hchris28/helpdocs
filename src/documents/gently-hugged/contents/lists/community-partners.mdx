# Community Partners

The Community Partners list is a list of community partners with images and links to their web sites. Each Community Partner has the following fields:

* **NAME**\
    The name of the Community Partner.

* **IMAGE** (Optional)\
    The logo of the Community Partner. If a logo is not supplied, the Name is used instead.  

* **LINK** (Optional)\
    A link to the Community Partners web site. If the Link is not supplied, the logo or name is still displayed.

* **FEATURED**\
    If you mark a Community Partner as featured, they will appear at the top of the list and the logo will be larger. Note: toggling Featured to ON will override the order they appear in the list. You don't need to re-order Featured partners to the top of the list manually.

<Aside>
    You can add the Community Partner list to a page using the [`<CommunityPartners />` Short Code](/gently-hugged/editing-content/short-codes/community-partners/).
