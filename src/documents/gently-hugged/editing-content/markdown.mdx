# Markdown

Our Content Management System uses Markdown for formatting content. You don't need to understand the ins-and-outs of Markdown to edit content, you can happily use the editors in Rich-Text mode without ever being away of Markdown. You can format text much like you would in a word processor like MS Word.

If you're interested in learning the syntax of Markdown, you can see the base syntax here: [Basic Syntax | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
