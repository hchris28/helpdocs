Much of the content you will enter will be simple text, numbers, or uploading an image. Sometimes though, formatted text is desirable, most notably in Page content but in other areas as well. To allow for text formatting, Decap uses a straight-forward text editor that allows for basic formatting. 

## Rich text (formatted text)

Some fields allow for formatted text. These content fields will appear as an editor with formatting buttons across the top. These fields work like an _extremely_ simpilifed version of MS Word or Google Documents. You can just start typing into the field and use the buttons at the top for apply formattting.

Form left to right, the formatting options are:

* Bold
* Italic
* Code (you probably won't use this)
* Link
* Heading Level (1-6)
* Quote
* Bulleted List
* Numbered List
* Components (plus sign)
    * Image
    * Code block (you probably won't use this)

In addition to formatted text, you can use what we call **[Short Codes](/gently-hugged/editing-content/short-codes/index/)**. Short Codes are special codes you can enter to represent larger, pre-formatted blocks of text. For example, if you want to show a list of all distribution sites on a page, all you need to do is enter `<DistributionSites />`.

<Aside>
We are utilizing a language called Markdown. You don't need to know anything about Markdown, but if you're interested in a brief intro you can see [this page](/gently-hugged/introduction/editing-content/markdown/) which will get you started. Ths switch on the right side of the formatting buttons allows you toggle between a preview and the Markdown source.

You can enter some HTML into these fields as well. You won't get a pretty preview in the editor, but simple HTML entered here will work just fine on the web site.
