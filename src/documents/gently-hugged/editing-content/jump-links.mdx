title: Jump Links
order: 5

If the content on your page gets very long, you might want to add jump links to help users navigate to specific sections of the page.

Jump links appear at the top of the page under the title and are automatically generated based on the headings in the content. To create a section that can be jumped to, add a 'Headhing 2' to the content. The text in the heading will the appear in the jump links as a link to the section.

To add the heading, select the text yiou want to use as a header in the editor and click the 'Heading 2' selection in the heading drop down.

If you're using Markdown, you can add a heading by adding 2 hash marks (`##`) before the text. For example:

```markdown
## Section Title
```

You don't need to do anything else to add the jump links. They will automatically appear at the top of the page.
