# Images

Images are used in various places on the web site. For example you can put images in page content as well as assign an image to each page's sidebar, you can attach images to news items, each community partner has an image associated with it, and there are others you will come across.

The process for uploading and/or selecting an image for use is the same wherever you find the image field. For instance, each page has a SIDEBAR IMAGE field, but this applies to any image field. 

If no image is selected, you will see 2 options: 

![Image field - no selction](/images/image-no-selection.jpg)

* **Choose an Image**\
    Selecting this will open the Images window where you can select an existing image or upload a new one.  
* **Insert from URL**\
    This option allows you to reference an image that is found elsewhere on the internet by using a URL.
    <Aside type="warning">
        **Insert from URL** is called "Hotlinking" and is generally not recommended. If you use this option make sure you either own the domain you are hotlinking from or have express permission to hotlink the image. The rest of this page focuses on the first option.

If an image is already selected, you will see a small preview of the image and have 3 options:

![Image field - with selction](/images/image-with-selection.jpg)

* **Choose different image**\
    Open the Images window to choose or upload a new image to replace the existing image.
* **Replace with URL**\
    Replace the image with a new image found elsewhere on the internet. See the warning about hotlinking above. 
* **Remove image**\
    Remove the image. Note that this does not delete the image, it only removes it from use in this particular field.

## Images Window

If the image you want to use has already been uploaded, you just need to find the image, click on it to select it, and then click on the "Choose Selected" button.

    You can search for images by file name from this window, the list of images is filtered as you start typing in the Search input in the upper left corner.

If you need to upload a new image, click the Upload button in the upper right corner. You will be presented with the option to select a file from your computer to upload. After you select a file, you will see the new image in the Images list and it will be selected. Now you just click on the "Choose Selected" button.

    This section only covers uploading and selecting images for use in content. To learn more about the other options in the Images window and general media management see the [Media View](/gently-hugged/media/index/) section.
